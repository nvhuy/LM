in modern digital world  electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as smart phones  computers and etc
in work places  electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporation
surveillance technology such as rfid  radio-frequency identification  is one type of examples that has currently been implemented
surveillance technology such as rfid can be operated twenty-four hours with the absence of operators to track done every detail about human activities
for instance  in militaries which are of high importance  surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidences if anything are fault
in supermarkets where it is difficult to catch stealers  surveillance technology which makes records that can be replayed or detect stealers on the spot are superior to use
the high accuracy in utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreements among people
it is useful as it reduces the chances of wrong doings that may occur
risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past
in late nineteenth century  there was a severe air crash happening at miami international airport
the air cargo of the valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off
sooner or later  the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed
all passengers and pilots were died
after finding and analyzing the black box of the valujet after the incidence  police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence
surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future  hence to save more lives
in addition  if surveillance technology is even better developed  it can be used to detect the problem before the real accidence has happened
however  the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in the invasion of privacy
therefore  surveillance technology provides convenience to the society but makes more inconvenience to individuals
in general  surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals  life
i do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people
in this fast moving society  technology is always improving to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army usage to track people down
although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy  it has also brought us lots of benefits and security
firstly  security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace
many of this surveillance are being implemented in the government sectors  military areas to enhance their security
it is useful to the government and the people in the law sector
this can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery
this technology can also be a helpful tool to assist the law enforcers such as the police to collect evidences of crime after it occurred
this can increase the efficiency of solving the crime and thus decreasing the amount of criminal acts or people
with the help of the video surveillance  the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased
this technology could also be seen as invasion of human s privacy
if everyone is being watched unknowingly  it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded
it may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people do crime
the knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it
the more people using it over us  the more power they will have on us
we should respect that everyone has human rights and without other s permission  this should not be placed or implanted to anyone
we do not want to be sued infringing other s privacy  therefore  before implanting any rfid  we should ask for other s consent
and after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life  products such as rfid tracking system have become real
rfid is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose  it is also used to track people by doing human implants
it is unacceptable for some people in the society  however  i think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit
for example  there are always news on newspaper  report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her
the family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly  and with the help of police office  maybe they can find the elderly back  but it will take a long time  and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person
however  if the elderly has been implanted with rfid devices  then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently
surveillance technology such as rfid is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries
it may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children
for example  they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but did n t pay attention to the child  so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price
since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than singapore  it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to
since this may happen across province  and without any clue about the path that the child may went through
however  if the child has been installed with tracking device  more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back
not only the details of location will be provided  but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family
surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to
as the technology increasingly advances  many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the possibles
from internet  email to the most powerful surveillance technology  every step is advancement to not only the society but also the world s achievements
people s lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury  thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the man s life
however  such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life ; it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful livings that can be out of our imaginations and estimations
today  the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go
take singapore for example  these are installed from highly secured places such as government sectors to working places  from condominiums to housing development board houses  and even from school canteens to toilets !
even our applications in our iphones or other smartphones  our i-pad can easily revealed our locations
every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes
i agree to a great extent that rfid technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted
on the other hand  i will also discuss the rfid shall be utilized for good purposes
though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-living paced livings  this can be a double-edged sword
hackers become increasingly vicious  invading into our computer system  now with radio-frequency tracking device  this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons
every moves of us are easily tracked
no matter how good and how many security systems are there for us  the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system
on the other hand  i think rfid can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage
for example  this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements  or contributing to more leads for solving a case
in this  i mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species  for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime
it can benefit our mankind if appropriately used
however  i think such powerful device shall not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of ill-intentioned  individuals
over these years  it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places
other than using it on these areas  it is also been used as human implant or as a form of products
there are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research
moreover  the use of rfid chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point
when rfid had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards  the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years
this form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order
as this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form
this also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages
these chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it
additionally  the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees
the clothes were all implanted with an rfid tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at
as their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company  the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of the logistical hassle
therefore  the usages of rfid chips were more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required
this form of tracking were also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race
therefore i agree that the use of the rfid technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mention above
nowadays  with the rapid development of science and technology  the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions
although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology  still the advantages of the new technologies can not be simply discarded
by investigating the track by the surveillance technology  they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing
it gives the police a better control of the criminal
all these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer
nowadays  people need to carry a lot of id cards around to show that i am the one the same as the one on the id cards
if we have these technologies  it will automatically confirm people s indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards
based on the identifiable environment  a lot of convention way or style of human life can be changed
for the privacy concern  if the technology can be made to adjust to human being s feeling  it will be more welcomed
for example  if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location  he or she can disable the track
i think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public
as you can see  there are quite a lot of advantages of using the surveillance technology to track people
besides  we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology
in my opinion  surveillance technology such as rfid should be used to track people though there do exist many problems if it prevails
without sending back any images or sound record  rfid is more user-friendly and helps prevent user s privacy at the best it can
the tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones  such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him  or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her
everyday crimes are happening from time to time  and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical  physiological and social problems
police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime
thus  when a man with a terrorism tag  entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man s behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode tnt
if rfid is used on everyone and running for years  surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city  from town to town  which city is expanding more than people thought  which city is becoming less attractive
statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures  what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made
economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country
as for transportation  roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes
but before the application  governments need to secure safety of rfid after implantation and make sure there will not be any id theft
it is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient
however  when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people  it is my opinion  that  such technology should rethink its way of existence
this already raises up a problem of privacy leakage
the surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people s privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people
this was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others
instead  when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper  it was heavily cricised by the public
government had to uninstall all the devices in the end
from this case  we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way  however  when it touches the privacy of people themselves  it is unacceptable
however  human beings are not animals or any other products  they have their own thoughts and freedom
they have a full control of their own lives
if so  then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like
it is understandable that once people have human implants  they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out
however  this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device
pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets
however  in countries like china  where there is no law to force people to chain their pets  pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets
this shows that even though there is a risk of causing harms to someone  people still prefers to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom
even pets are granted with freedom  people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential
it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects  but also cause leakage of personal information
surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectors
example of this technology is rfid  radio-frequency identification  which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or rfid tags on people
the leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal  violation of freedom and breakdown of safety
one of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip
criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved
other than that  safety issue can be extended to personal safety
everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as facebook
however  people tend to express their personal feeling and idea about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally
this action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant
internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person
in addition  the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched
mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally
in a nutshell  surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately
however  it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at current level
i would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerabilities of technology at present
nowadays  the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different people
for instance  face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone s location
there exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology
another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never being there before
then  the person is able to use gps or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before
for instance  when people getting old  they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place
although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful  it still has to be used in volunteering bases
these kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them
at the same time  our location should be protected from seen by the strangers
all the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like  the time of tracking and who can view your location
in conclusion  the advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety
at the same time  people must protect their privacy without share their place to strangers
overall  the benefit of these technologies overweight its problems occurred if people use it wisely
the increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development
by following the trend of improvement in technology  people can now easily tracked by using rfid  radio-frequency identification  by simply implant a rfid tags on human body
by taking an example in any country  there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits had been arrested and being punished
there are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers
in that case  they would have no choice but to seek for the power of loyal police
the detective will start investigate the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities
there is only 10 % of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim
in that sense  without a proper way to track human being  it is way too difficult to save those innocent life
few years ago  there was a jailbreaker named mat selamat  one of the members of the terrorists of osama  successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in singapore
according to news  the police force had mobilized thousand of cops  each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months  none of them was able to find mat selamat and rearrested him
people fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode
if rfid comes into existence  this kind of cases can be totally avoided in no time
beside  if rfid is supposed to be use by the public  everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family
with the power of internet  there is nothing impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea
in spite of that  smart phone is still a device that need to be recharged its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object
imagine when people camping in forest or hills  they will just lost all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone running out of batteries
in that case  if they get lost or lose contact  they will be considered as the lost and eventually  they will not survive
in conclusion  rfid benefited people more than brought harmful side effect to human body by considering for human safety
nowadays  technology is more advance than the past time
after the invention of phone and internet  there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even track people
in this mean time  surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere
definitely  there are point of view that agree the technology but also the voices of objection
initially  surveillance technology such as rfid  radio-frequency identification  is implanted into the body of animals
besides that  many animals which just be released from the protection of human for a long time are implanted the rfid as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life
this technology are encouraged by some of the public that to implant the rfid into prisoners  body
the initial function is good indeed that to track the movement of them to protect the public safety and interest if they are out of prison
however  some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the rfid into prisoners  body
their opinions are founded on the basic human rights
after they release from the prison  the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government
they feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine
furthermore  some of parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the rfid into their children s body
however  there are both sides of stories
this technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy
children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible to take good care of them
although the initial function of implementation of rfid is good for the children  however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology
besides tags into human body  there is also the issue of implant into products
recently  many of cell phone are equipped with gps which means that they can find the device s location if it is lost
it is also the advance of surveillance technology
children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents
compared to the human implant  tags on the products is better and more suitable
under the products tags  children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant
it is the ways that can  using one stone to kill two birds
as world pace becomes faster and faster  the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field
with the information about the location of the cargo  it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company
rfid is one of the advanced technology for tracking
due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature  it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics
however  it is not a reasonable idea to use rfid to track people by human implants or rfid tags on daily products like watch or clothes  it did provide convenience in a certain situation
the biggest difference between human and animals or any other objects is that we have self-esteem or we need the basic respect from our peer
one of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy
in any period of time  as long as we do not offense others  we should enjoy the right of privacy
since rfid tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time  it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities
however  the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag  so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address  working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information
if this piece of information is misused  chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer
moreover  if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes  then the location of one will be revealed every seconds
although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose  it is still not appropriate
we can think about this scenario : the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second
as what we have mentioned above  as human being  we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others
does the society need surveillance or not ?
some good examples such as the internet  computers and satellites are now quite common for humans  normal life ; however  some problems also emerge  with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians
in the modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples  mind
even if the safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life  many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing some potential danger
the contradiction of the safety and the privacy can not be reconciled perfectly
with the installing of the surveillances for every corner of singapore  people s life has a safe security  and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments
this is because of two reasons  one is the strict law in singapore  and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere
during the year 2003  surveillance strategies helped singapore beat the sars and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation
at that time  singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient s home to look after their actions
much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in singapore
without the using of the surveillance  the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly  and the loss caused by sars might be many times than that in 2003 in singapore
the benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of sars  and this is a success example of the surveillance
in one way the surveillance help government guard civilians  property and life  in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours  monitoring
in the novel 1984  written by george orwell  author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they doing everything
every words people say can be heard by the government and because of that  government know well about everyone s mind and want to wash everyone s mind and control normal people totally
in the reality  people are afraid of being tracking everywhere  not because of meaning to crime  but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone s heart
when a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife  none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors
normal people s privacy needs government seriously considered about
people needs a safe environment to live in  and also needs a private environment to stay independent
the surveillance is a useful method to keep society s safe  but also kills the privacy of people in some degree
the best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life  and then the surveillance is no more needed
at that time  even if there is no surveillance above people s heads  there are surveillances in everyone s heart and criminals are more difficult to hide
around people  there are full of high technology like cctvs  automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems
in order to bring more benefit and ensure people s safety  surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in ups and dhl  these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods
however  besides tracking goods for people  people begin to use this technology to track people
i do not agree this kind of behavior  because humans are different from goods  can not treat humans as goods
there is no a doubt  tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age
no matter where people go  taking bus or mrt  people are under the cctvs  it is very important and useful to track and find people
actually  tracking system has provided people safety indemnification
however  tracking people are difficult and different from goods
for instance  a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in singapore  and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another
if one company really uses this technology to track their employees  employees will dislike and claim that their humans  right and privacy have been violated
in another a word  people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods  because modern people need more homage not money
so  when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system  they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards
finally  the company tracking system has no meaning at all  therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people
in addition  tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way
how to explain this problem  it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system
for example  people go somewhere  no matter taking bus  mrt or driving  they are under the cctvs
if some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes  by hacker technology  they can use government tracking system to do their own business
in other words  government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety  now it has been divulged human information
it is very dangerous for society  because people do not know who are tracking them  it must bring citizens trepidation
in conclusion  what i have mentioned above  we have to agree  tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world
also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose
radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio-frequency electromagnetic field
more interestingly  this technology is being used in human identification  even planting the chip into human body
this fact becomes very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information releasing without knowing also brings the public s concern
in some fields  surveillance technology did have brought us tremendous benefit and advantage
in the transportation  almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport
for the society  there will be a more efficient transportation system
for the logistics  if all the products are attached to the tags  it is much easier to count and record all the products
since the inventory management is very important for some kind of companies  this technology is playing a very significant role
the super markets are also using this technology to tag their product  which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent of stealing
this will save the customers time and also improve the profit of the market
the libraries also use this technology to identify the membership of the people entering  which ensures the security and the member itself will also conserve their information made in this library
in some kindergartens  the rfid is used to tab the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts
by rfid  the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost  because the rfid can help them get it back
this will inversely improve the sale of the shop
although in many respects  this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways  in some area it is so controversial
the most controversial part may be the human identification
by using this card  our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept
another human identification is implanting rfid chips into human body
for this part  not only the privacy problem is concerned  but the human health
actually  this technology is very useful and should be definitely go on be used
what should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way
if there are some controversy  how it can be improved
only if it be made use in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly  can it bring us the maximized benefit
the technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease the illegal actions effectively
it records the history which nobody can deny
in crime investigation  the truth of evidence is necessary  which can only be made by photos  videos or small tracks
in supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves
in front of atm we need monitor to avoid intentional crime
the objective truth in cctv is helpful and efficient in crime investigation  better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the liar
secondly  surveillance technology can decrease the illegal actions effectively
imagine there are no cctv in public
cheating can be very popular in examination and stealing will seldom incur punishment
children told their parents
some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said
now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a monitor  otherwise the teachers  action can not be supervised
if there had been a monitor in the classroom  maybe parents and headmaster could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier
the problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power
there is a truth that we can not deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people
we have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depend on a sound legal system  and it means surveillance has its own restriction
this is more than convenient for the authority to take better control of the society down to every individual
by law  citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public  whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely
many pupils in china have been complaining about their phones  because with the phones at hands  their lives are all transparent to their parents
such technology would put people into the same circumstance as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second
if pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents  citizens definitely are unhappy being watched by the big brother
close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feelings  but also a problem of the health of the society
some people may claim that it is good for security as when every one is under tracking  those poteintial criminals also are
by logic it seems perfectly right
however  whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority
when the authority treats liberty as a crime  the society becomes terrible
it has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in
many science fictions have made good efforts in describing a future of human in which every body in society is put under close surveilliance of the governments
surprisingly  none of these are describing the future as a bright one
in history  there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs  such as the nazi germany  the soveit union
if such thing does happen  then the society would be moving on a dangerous direction without being noticed
imagine that one day  one is suddenly arrested from his normal life by the police and tolded that he is accused of posting anti-society statements on the internet
and all the evidences have been collected by hidden surveillance when he though he was expressing his opinion in the safe house !
in summery  surveillance technology shall not be used to track people in order to keep the society comfortable and safe to live in
what should really be put into close surveillance is the government
people must make sure that the government is not abusing its power in ways including tracking people
there is one thing is common in the world described in many fiction - chips are implanted in human and records its location  history and even thoughts at that time
the readers are just smiling when they flip the page because it never comes to their mind that one day it might come true
however  the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us down
travelers survive in desert thanks to gps guide them
the police seize the criminal thanks to cctv
having power can help people to achieve lots of things ; however  abusing will guide us to another direction
although we are not implanted chips we are exposed under cctv
we can not deny that surveillance technology is a great achievement that securing us and protect us from criminal but we also can not ignore the lease of our privacy and even limit our freedom
my life now is exposed to lots of cctv
every day when i opened my door and go to lady s through the corridor  i was recorded by 3 cctv
when i work  it seems i am holding my heart working since if i am doing something wrong or relax in working time
next minute  i may have a tea with my manager
although we all understand the installing of cctv is used for protect us from criminal  nowadays  it seems to be abused too much
according to article lawful interception  in us  every telecommunication companies have contract with fbi  requiring them to keep the phone call record easily searchable and accessible for fbi
moreover  as showed in many hollywood movies  google mail is also accessible for fbi
there are so many people in fbi  although it is under strict rule  and we can not think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out
leasing of private information  even though it only happened one time  but one is too many for an individual
moreover  the money spend on telephone call record is $ 1 8 million per year
our life is not only exposed to big brother
instead  owing to cctv  telephone and other rfid  we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone  but we seldom notice it  that is why it is horrible to our life
as the fast growing of electrical technology  people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of it
because of the surveillance technology  more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used
that is to say  there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology
we can not imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor
that sounds like we are naked in front of the public  there is no secret and even privacy for us
perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety  but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety
therefore  the surveillance technology can not be casually used
and once this happens  privacy does not exist any more and people s life is under great threaten
therefore  this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared
and he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house
then if his house got stolen  the perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back
from the reasons above  we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily life
however  we can take the essence and reject its dross
contrarily  it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security
therefore  the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs
surveillance technology such as radio-frequency identification  rfid  to track the population is potentially is dangerous weapon by the governments against its own people
using surveillance technology such as radio-frequency identification  rfid  to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as the identification cards
illustrations that is both hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies  such as the bourne identity
judging from the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters  human traffickers  and the yukuza from his book  it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human taking opportunity on this marvelous tracking technology
the ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret polices
an example is the nazis secret police of hitler used to dispose  their bodies literally  and stamp out any of hilter s oppositions using fear  and maybe guns  knives  poison
trends of the highly emotionally and easily manipulated humans can be tracked  analysis  archived and chronicled
an example of making an good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path  where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people needs a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a randomly location
knowing that this is the favorable route by the people  the government now has sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefits the people
with the development of technology  we have more advanced method to track people in today s society
however  the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly  and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned
some socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned
however  people who are taking security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively
in my point of view  surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions
although that method may invade certain people s right and privacy  but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society
if the surveillance technology is abandoned  it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society
for example  without surveillance technology  the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position
without surveillance technology  the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police can not arrive in time to help out
on the other hand  the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police
although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned  regulations of using that is expected
with the popularization of surveillance technology  a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed
for example  making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided  which is also a effective way to protect human right
only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected
with proper use of surveillance technology  surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police  and also benefit all the society
it is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invade human rights  however  for the sake of whole society  surveillance technology should still be used
as long as the regulations of using that are obeyed  surveillance technology can serve as a good tool
in the modern society  public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon
in the united states  after the horrible attack on 11 september  the us congress passed the patriot act  which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance  to counter against the terrorists
however  although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again  the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacy
with the development of surveillance technology such as rfid  spy on the population can be much easier  which will create even worse scenery for the citizens
in this paper  the incorrectness of using technology such as rfid to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy  the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority
first  the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased
typically  the rfid tags are small devices with a read-only chip
once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals  all the information about his or her life can be recorded
some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use rfid for identification in place like airport and check point
furthermore  such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person
that is to say  people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness
in such situation  individuals will lose their basic privacy
third  to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority
however  once the government gathers too much power  the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism  and such surveillance technology provides the measures
spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step
when government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens  it can gradually apply control over them
consequently  the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority  which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen
all in all  surveillance technology such as rfid should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy  the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority
privacy must be respected  and power over other should be controlled
with the development of the science and technology  people nowadays are living under various surveillances  for example  cctvs can be seen almost everywhere in public area
some people think rfid should be banned out of privacy consideration
however  as far as i am concerned  using rfid to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration  rescue and police events
during scientific exploration  especially the geographical ones  the tracking is very important
this tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back
when these scholars are on the field journey  they also have to relate their observation with their route information ; this is when rfid is of great significance
for this kind of situation  rfid will help a lot
firstly  knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger
furthermore  by telling the geographical position of the people  rfid can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims
during the rescue  every second is valuable !
by getting the track of the suspensors  police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event
policeman can just go to the certain place and chase the criminal
besides  tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem
firstly  for scientific exploration  rescue and police events  the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results
by using this technology reasonably  it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path
without doubt  surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people s information without getting their permission
when i have such feelings  i will feel that i am not belongs to human beings as everyone else any longer  instead  i am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others
on the other hand  when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people  it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions
as to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy  i think we should not use it to track people
the rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages ; high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people
however  it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in workforce
rising life expectancies is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement
rising life expectancies result in fewer workforces available
fewer young people and more elder people are existed globally
although current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower  manpower is required to operating these machines so that they can better functioned
in countries like singapore  manpower is the only natural resources available which singapore can invest on as she does not have enough lands to build farms and factories
in addition  singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which are mainly consisting of services
more elderly people are a burden to the society as more funds are required by the governments to support their standard of living
more healthcares are needed for elderly people than young adults
in most countries healthcare are provided freely from government
as a result  government need more taxed from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people
this is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes
despite the challenges from ageing population  it is an achievement as less people are in competency to bid for one job position
therefore  people are generally less stressed in working
rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living is improved for majority of people
they can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health to a better condition
in conclusion  rising life expectancies is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development
however  it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society is progressed well and people are living with better conditions
with the ageing population  many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses  facilities to cater to the old aged
first  i will discuss on the challenge of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall
when people start to age  many diseases will surface up un-noticing
land space will be limited when more hospice are build to take care of the elderly people
however  not many young people are passionate about helping the society or even helping the elderly
the ageing population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to have a healthy lifestyle by the people
the more old people the country has  the more experience they will be as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and making them not make the same mistakes as them
the more exercise or any other forms of work out can prolong the lifespan of people
an example will be in korea
thus  food can play an important role to the population
therefore  every country should try to maintain both young and old generation balanced
studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectancies
it is clear that population aging is happening all over the world  since the current average life span is 65 and the population above the age of 60 is getting increased year after year
this shows the rising of life expectancies  it is an achievement and it is also a challenge
the rising life expectancies may be due to several different reasons  for example  it may be because of the improvement of the living condition  or because of the upgrade of the cleanness of the living environment  or because of the wide arrange of nutrition that absorbed by the human  or because of the development of the medication system in the country
no matter which reason stated above exactly dominant to the rising of life expectancies it is one of the evidence of the achievement of human nation
it is the technology developments enable the improvement of the living condition ; the discover of the food and the nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for human to absorb ; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases
without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago  with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and the human nations have no solution
the rising of life expectancies shows the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so many centuries therefore it is an achievement
however  the rising of life expectancies is also a challenge to the entire human nation
with the population ageing problem getting more and more serious all over the world  the shortage of various kind of resources challenge most of the countries in the world
first  food resource and medication resource are the most important to support the living human beings
and also the over crowded modern cities also raise problem of public transportations  unevenly distributed wealth and education resources shortage also are the problems that some countries that may face to
although rising of life expectancies is an challenge to the entire human nation  the detailed problems each country that will encounter is different
it is clear that problems that may face for developed and developing countries are different
for developing countries  they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and and the problem of how to develop better medication system to serve the entire nation  and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population  more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country
for developed countries  the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face the public transportation problem and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of the human society in terms of technology which improve the life quality
in conclutin  the rising life expectancies can be considered both challenge and achievement
ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries
people of the nations are likely to be well-taken care of  partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective government
rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs
this means  having an elderly at home is equivalent to having a gold at home
where filial piety and respect for the elder are highly emphasized in chinese traditions  the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as for their parents
an individual is an unit of the society  every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society and nation s growth
on the other hand  the rising life expectancy can also be an indication  though not entirely  of a country s reputation to their citizens
a long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes being related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received
this gives credits to the government s medical and healthcare schemes
however  this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates of a nation s provision of quality healthcare benefits and livings for the senior citizens
ageing population is often viewed negatively by the developed countries where they are economic driven
in order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders the economic development  more physically capable and young workforces are required in the society
if failed to fulfil this requirement  this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the societal or company working groups
this can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government  decreasing birth rates where people could not afford the children expenses of their upbringings and educational fees  that adds on more burdens and worries for the government
as an overall  the rising life expectancies can be considered as a pro and con to the country
pro  in terms of the intangible aspects such as emotional and mental development of the future generations and contribution to a country s well reputation
con  on the other hand  in terms of tangible aspect mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world
the rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of human could be medically disturbing
these few problems were taking a toll in human lives over the years when they were over 60 years of age
it is a challenge where this illness ca n t be easily avoided by any person in such a stressful lifestyle in any place in the world
medical advances which help in curing this illness were also getting better over the year which helps in the rise in life expectancy
when a person grows old  the medical needs of a person increase over the years relative to the age of a person
the number and types of illness also increases relative to the age too
as the amount of stress  the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of environment were getting worst
more variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human
by the rate of environmental damage  we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being had to be changed
therefore the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is a huge challenge
the ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical ability to solve and eliminated the harm that is able to take the life of a human away at a earlier age
all these technology advancement also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyle  environment and medical ability
therefore  achieving such great fret  in these areas is considered as an achievement where human lives is then improved and extended the life of us
moreover  achieving the near impossible to eliminate all the illness such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement for human race
this step needs the ability to take a long time of research to make it possible
much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human being
in conclusion  we could see that on order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illness that could be growing over the year  the damage to our living environment and stresses that are always building in the city life
there is always a way out where the achievements were done by the humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy
rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement
the first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge
the second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement
they are not contradicting with each other
so  in the following  i will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies
for the first part  rising life expectancies is a challenge
we should image that when the life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising
the number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher
for these older people  the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them
however  these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society
we have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources
not only has the family member of the old people  but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation
this is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies
for the second part  rising life expectancies is also an achievement
the achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past
in the ancient time  due to the less development of science and technology  people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy
bad mood can not give them a longer time of life
so  the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living
besides  we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder  the older people
in such a situation  the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way
life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem
however  there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement
rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on development of medication
there are a series of diseases that hinders longevity
other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers  the current medication does have methods to treat the patient  but risks still come along
apart from diseases themselves  deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer
patients in many developing and less developed countries  especially african countries  are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life  albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people
government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system
development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable
compared with the world of ancient rome or china where almost no machines are involved  people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories
as a result  people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life
one can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime
one can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away
more importantly  they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through internet  to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful
in conclusion  it is delighted to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising  but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy
there are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication
but data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life
while it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives  there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies
without a doubt  the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases
the improvement in technology also eases people s lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works
due to the three major factors stated above  people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments  are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work
the rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation
this creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable
this would result in the lose of manpower in a country
this would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum
government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it
less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business
afterall  it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows  especially the developed countries with very small population
however  when we look at the brighter side of the reality  the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past  there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication
life expectancy can be defined as desired level of service or better technology to make one s life more comfortable
people in current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancies in another word
they are expecting better medication  healthier food  and cleaner environment and so on and so forth
however  this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also and an achievement in the population ageing
percentage of elder is increasing annually according to united nations  projection
in another word  there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compare to younger people in this world population
on the other hand  people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as newer i-pad model
in fact  these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past
however  ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it
ageing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy
ageing population requires more medical sources since elders needs more medical attention
however  the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide
nevertheless  provision of more medicine and better equipments as well as more medical centre is necessary to accommodate these elders
another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation
ageing population is a consequence of increasing health level of population
the concurrent result is increasing size of population
in addition  the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family
this phenomenon increases the demand of land property and subsequently affects their price and size together
increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply
the production of food is showing a lower growth rate compare to population s growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future
rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments
people expect more on the ground of their current economy  life stability and desire
for an example  one would like to have i-phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate in faster speed after using it a while
thus  the rising expectancies actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people s life and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts  economical statues  convenience and others
rising life expectancies is an achievement but it poses more challenges to government and people
all have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges on the way of meeting expectancies
otherwise  the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered down when the time passes or people should lower their expectancies of life
from one perspective  it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases
from another perspective  there are more and more elder people but less younger ones  the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so on
firstly  the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology
compare the technology today and the past  we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable  the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases
the fast development of medicine and technological product makes people s life much healthier compare to the past
people are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand
although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies  it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement
the technology is always improving and it never stops  and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well
thus  we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation
the first challenge is the decreasing number of new born
as the population ageing are growing  as people getting old  they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young
if the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people  it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less  the productivity and technology improvements will be less
at the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones  which gives the younger generation extra works
as we know that population of human continues in growth year by year  we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life  for example  the oil  people s life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil
however  these natural resources are not renewable
we do not consider much for our offspring
ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left what will be the life of our next generation
the increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some idea like to prevent using too much natural resources
in conclusion  the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like lack of young generation
we have to consider more about our future generation  aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges
soon after coming into the industrial age  human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic era
an improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises
studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years  in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more
in spite of that  people should aware that the power of science is not almighty  life will still go to their last page without revelation
since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor  people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence  they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health
there is needless to doubt that the medical technology has enhanced day by day
in the past  when people injured or fall into sickness  there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered  therefore people can easily die by infected of a small disease
with the grand medical skill we are having nowadays  human lived longer and hence  a great increasing in population
it would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day  but in reality  it does not seem to be so easy
firstly  although the treatment is reliable  people would still need to have the awareness of their own health condition
there are millions of doctor all over the world  but there are billions of patients as well
nowadays  the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that  people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement
pressure can really cause sickness just like virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease
it is like a key that open up the gate of human body defend system and provide a cleared path for other disease to attack in
therefore  when the era is improving itself  the disease does it too
it is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keeping the life span to grow as people do sick every moment
nevertheless  human still need an improvement
by comparing to the past  it is a big step forward in development of medical science
in the era of warring state  warriors lose their arms or legs or even all of them
the rest of their life has to be relied on their family and the financial support from the others
their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others
disabled people walks with artificial legs  man can getting pregnant  even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery
it is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history
in conclusion  the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of the global medical science
average life span rise from 45 years old in 1920s to over 65 years old in 2010s
in the social science report last year  this number will further increase to 90 years old in 2080s due to the advance medical technology and better living standard
population ageing means that there are more retired old people in the society and the portion of working adults is decreased
it may cost higher social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds in government yearly budget
medical expenses  epf and accommodation are the costs which directly involved to the old people
it is responsibility of government to ensure the living of old people
otherwise  there are more and more people staying at the street and destroy the good view of garden city
in addition  it is also a challenge for government  family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial
with the moral of filial  most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life
it is to prevent from sending them to old folk s house and do not visit them at all
we also do not want to see the happening of worst things that parents are dropped by children along the streets and let them die themselves
it may be a challenge but also golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes
life expectancies rise significantly from the past to recent in the whole world
it is the outcomes of advance medical technology  changing of lifestyle and higher living standard
however  among the under-developed countries  developing countries and developed countries  we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries
the observation means that the more developed the countries  the longer the life span of citizens
in the other words  it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population
it is proud to have the ageing population which is hard to achieve unless there are advance medical technology and higher living standard
besides that  ageing population has an important and essential thing that we can not buy in cash
there is the experience in life time
during the work  supervisor usually asks the so called  old staff  to lead the newbie
with the existing of experience  we can do the work more quickly without sacrifice the standard and quality
it may leads a shorter ways to the decision and provide more sales and revenue for company
the economy of country is boosted up and further leads to the new development and rise up our living standard
in conclusion  there are challenges as well as achievement in the rising life expectancies which we can not exclude
as the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years  people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life
however  as the life expectancy of people rises  population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon
as the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development  it can be seen an achievement of human being
however  as the energy and resources use up  more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem  so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge
as we are human who are different from other animals  we have some basic rights like right to privacy  right to live  right to have a family and so on
during the less developed times  due to disasters like droughts floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths  people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time
however  as the technology develops  it increased people s mobility and productivity so as life expectancies
as we can use the resources with maximum efficiency  we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society
even when the disaster comes  we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time than before
cnn  2011  however  only one year has passed  most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory
with the strong back support of technology  the rises of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society
however  along with the increase of life expectancies  ageing problems becomes more and more severe
two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility
the increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure
the increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility
moreover  as we use up more and more resources  what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology
therefore  the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge
as we have mentioned above  the increase of life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge
in modern world  many global issues have been appeared like global warming  concept of earth village and population
nowadays  population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries
population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies  it is challenging also can get some achievement
in the first place  rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge
so rising life expectancies will make the world population larger  more people shall the limited resources
in economic  we can use gdp to explain the challenge  if gdp is low  it shows that most of people are living in a hard life  life quality is bad  then it will cause the terrible society problem  at last  it will happen the society disturbance
the reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation
on the other hand  rising life expectancies could bring some achievements
because the life and health are most significant  people have their own reasons to hope living longer
on medicine  people have done a lot of researches on life science
also people begin to realize the importance of the environment  how to protect people from the harmful air
so according to the humanism  people should make contribution to rising the humans life  because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older  so respecting life should be considered carefully
in addition  now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancies  it will lead a resources problem
however  based on the humanism  humans are different from the animals  people should respect every life
to summary  we respect every life  also help people to live longer
in conclusion  what i have mentioned above  although global aging issue has become more serious on humans development  if we can balance and understand why we live
then try to invent new energy and legitimately control population birth rate  then developing the medical treatment and paying enough attention  we have reasons to trust  population aging will not be problem at all
due the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate  the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger
as our society develops  the people have a much higher living standard  which will reduce the chance of getting disease
besides  as the development of the technology  the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress
on the other hand  the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing  whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure
maybe  it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive  the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career
maybe that s one reason for the reducing of the birth rate
this survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people s living standard has been improved
it also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown
first  if the older people increase  there will be fewer workforces that can support the society
however  ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure
the most important part is health care and old-age pension
as elderly people  they need more money for health care than the younger
government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure
secondly  for the older people  more facilities and service for them should be provided
so more manpower will be employed  which deduces the labour in other area
to pay this extra money  government will exert higher taxed on the other people
thirdly  compared to the young people  the security of the elderly is more notable
to conclude  the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy  medical skills and living standard
more elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government
rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population
it is natural that rising life expectancies is regarded as an achievement
people with rising life expectancies can ensure large population and large species of human being
rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology
rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person
longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over
rising life expectancies can be a challenge
on one hand  if there are less young people and more old people  lacking work force problem will arise
on the other hand  if there are enough young people  then young people with rising life expectancies will cause larger population
if there are less young people and more old people  as in both singapore and china  when elderly retire  there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions
thus there will be a lacking in labor force  which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country
the past 30-year rapid development of china is connected with the large population  but due to the  only child  policy  we have no benefits from large population in the future
with low birth rate  singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country
if there are more young people  then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely
population is large while the resources are limited  which will incur many problems such as environmental problems and inequality among people
expansion of population can not continue like that because the resources are limited  and we will end with dying out after using up all resources
to sum up  with rising life expectancies  there exist both achievement and challenge
it is a progress of human being that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies  but it also has potential crisis for either nation or the human being
population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations it requires at least three conditions to happen : advanced health care system  reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens
however  when it happens  it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labors to the society
if a country can bear a ageing population  it is a thing that the country can be proud of
in the first place  it must have grasped advanced health care system
ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies
without advanced health care system  aged people have higher rate of death
if developed health care system is increasing the positive side  it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side  which including reducing the hazards from the environment
a major source of the hazards is the pollution
a place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents  among which aged people and children will be harmed most
if the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system  they do require a software to function  which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens
if a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment  but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens  it just does not help
only when there is a ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can the aged people live well  and that is a thing to be proud of
with the glory  there comes problems
to take care of old people  facillities such as nursing homes should be built  which add on to the expense of society
an even larger share of the old people expense lies in the health care
when the percentage of old people grows larger in the population  the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people
in summary  the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society  including at least advaced advanced health care system  reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens  at the same time
the weak is meat and the strong eat it  does not apply nowadays
the advance technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away
for people  this is an achievement  but for nature  it changes its rule and cycle  which is a big challenge faced by human being
they may die for hunger  die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again
here  red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away
the first time when i read this saying i am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later i was told that in past  it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old  you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away  so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer
even though people with cancer  which is still hard to cure  now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live
in the same time  it also frees a great amount of labor
now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one
it is a break-through of technology and science  and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom
making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life  it sounds like perfect  but we must face to the reality -- there is no utopia
before people find another planet to live  the earth is the only habitat for us  and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings  it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live
furthermore  thanks to the development of technology  that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing
to our disappointment  now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources
before robots can fully replace labor  the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use
it is such a challenge that human being can not avoid and must solve
while we are celebrating for the break-through of our way to utopia  we are suffering facing to a new challenge
we can not give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn
moreover  the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy
however  while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy  we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing
there is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation
therefore  the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement
on one side  we can not deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies
the reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution  and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned
so the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves
on the other side  we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by the rise of life expectancy
since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality  we are leading a longer life
this seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight
however  during the process of making development to our life  we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down
but the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth
that is to say  the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society
then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face
taken together  we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided
it has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging
therefore  we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried
it is well-known statistics that  generally  as a country develops the life expectancies increases
this is the result of better quality of life ; which is basically sufficient food and clean water  better sanitations and advanced health-care
better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses
advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual s existence on earth
examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics  the cure of poliomyelitis  and better and cleaner surgical procedures
all of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies  and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement
it is remarkable that population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually in developing countries as well
it is highly plausible that the results for increase are the same as the developed countries
fewer famines  better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century s greatest achievement as a global society
although life expectancies may increase significantly  the population overall productivity may not increase linearly
they will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing their whole working career
rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy
if the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies  it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment
the challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable
the rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life ; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets
there are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly  and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthier
by projections of the united nations  it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2 % to 3 % in the developed and developing countries respectively
the rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings
however  as there are only limited space and resource on earth  rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide
back to the ancient days  when human beings firstly appeared on the earth  the average life expectancy is only less than 20
with the development of society  of the past thousands of years  the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising  so that higher life expectancies are achieved
such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings
however  since the space and resource on earth is very limited  higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable
many violence happened in middle east is just due to the fight for food and water resource
in a word  the rising in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings
the advanced technology has helped us to live longer  but the limited resource on earth is also a big challenge
with the development of the modern society  people lives longer
statistics shows that worldwide  the average life expectancy at birth was 66 57 years for 2009 according to cia world factbook 2009
in the developed countries like japan and switzerland  the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80
normally  people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement  and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries
however  as the population is ageing  the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized
in a nut shell  rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge
indeed  thanks to improved living standard and medical care  countless people s lives are extended
in the long history of the evolution  we are always struggling for life against staving and illness
in last two centuries  we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society
we are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care
in the ancient times  the residents may only live for 30 years ; but now  the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries
with a doubled life time  humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life
hence  the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement
on the other hand  the aging of population can also be a challenge to the society
that is the natural law which nobody can violate
hence  when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point  the challenge to the society can not be neglect anymore
first  the medical cost will rise greatly
second  the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society
japan society is now facing severe ageing problem  and the path of development is seriously slowed
there has been a report estimated that at the year 2060  only half of the population in japan are suitable to work
obviously  rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge
to conclude  the rising life expectancies must be considered both an achievement and a challenge
the population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals  lives
these two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number
when mentioning about the population ageing  media always consider it as a social problem
following are the more specific explanations
the rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems
it is a natural rule that when people grow older  their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower  so they will contribute less to the society
in addition  elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource  as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status
to make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger  old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus
this may lead to the younger s lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost
besides  the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard ; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation
they can live a happy life  but actually to the society as a whole  it is a waste of social resource
also  the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change
above all  the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society
however  the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society
long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems
for the whole society  rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field  better social environment and a safer world
therefore  human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement
the rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world
rising life expectancies  not only an achievement  but also a challenge
the rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement  but also a great challenge
obviously  rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology  insurance condition  culture development  and our social system  which shows the improvements of people s life quality
this is the great achievement made by the generation
with the population ageing and the increasing portion of the old people  we are facing lots of problems now
for individuals  since people s life expectancies are becoming longer  there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves  especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor
for example  it becomes hard for them to earn their livings ; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died ; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases
for families  certainly  the burden for young people is becomes heavier
that means when the child grows up  they need to take care of both parents
for a few groups of families  there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also live with them
and at the same time  these old people take up a larger portion of resource and budges of this society
also  the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology  higher level of civilization of our life
if our spiritual aspect of civilization can not match our material aspect  old people will have a tough twilight years
after a country was just founded  some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger
since no one knew about this disease before  it spread around the whole world before human taking action
the war kills a lot of people  which is not doubtful
no matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another  people just did n t live a long life
although some countries in africa and southeast asia still face a lack of medical insurance  the world in all is getting better in the field
with modern machine and growing method  human do n t need to worry about the amount of food anymore
all the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people
as the society develops  people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems
with more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government  the society s balance is broken
it is difficult to keep economy functioning well
with more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment  population ageing always comes first
no matter what measures they take  the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies
genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease
people get certain disease because of genetic changes
if your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease  it is still possible that you develop heart disease
however for some rare diseases  people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease
when we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease  are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
on one hand  we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families  later lives
when people around us know that we got certain disease  their altitudes will be easily changed  whether caring us too much or keeping away from us
and both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people
surrounded by such concerns  it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems
it is a concern that will be with us during our whole life  because we will never know when the  potential bomb  will explode
on the other hand  if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease  we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family
for an example  if exercising is helpful for family potential disease  we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise
and we keep track of all family members health conditions
at the same time  we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease
here i want to share forest view on this issue
although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for huntington s disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings  there currently is no legal requirement to do so
nothing is absolute right or wrong
if certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others  it is ok to disclose the result
above all  life is more important than secret
genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle
afterall  what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up  shared by either of the parents
in cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder  disclosing or otherwise  to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system
the issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk  one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles  aunts or cousin
this also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile  he or she concurently has a knowledge about others
this knowledge maybe relavant to them  and vice versa
do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives ?
in retrospect  its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own
sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication
depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example  the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being allowed  to tell
for example  within a family  regardless of who had first received genetic information  parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring  either adult at risk
in addition  a woman testing positive for brca1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself  although this may be further complicated by an individual s response to risk information as they not want to know
hence  there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know  such as nieces and nephews  nor persuade those with authority  the parents  to do so
the notion of authority also extended vertically
from a practitioner s perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists  views of family relationships  or about which blood  or non-blood  relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context
ultimately  one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure
whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how directive  the risk is to them
people with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes
in this case  if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk  it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows
in my opinion  although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy  it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease
focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first
large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease
especially for the young people without marrige  if he/she is known to have some genetic risk  it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease  but not in certain
therefore  to keep the information as secret to his/her future spouce would help the relationship
secondly  annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue  although the factor would not be that serious  people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease  and this creats unnecessary costs to the family
furthermore  the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease
on the other hand  if the genetic risk is kept as a secret  although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep the privacy  but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives
first  for the case of marrige  people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings
it is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found
secondly  genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits
for example  if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes
in this case  the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars  and at the same time  if the carrier tell this information to the relatives  it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease
otherwise  if the other parties did not know  they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention
in conclusion  we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs
therefore  it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives  in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises
among all kinds of different diseases  a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons
genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases
it is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene
from the legal aspect  the answer is no but from the ethical aspect  the answer should be yes
we ca n t make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem
firstly  someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy
privicy protection belongs to one s human rights
if a law requires someone to tell others  his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so
it is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law s spirit
the law s spirit also include the fairness
what is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders
it is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder
in addition  it is impractical to make such a law
a good law should be clear and easy to execute
however  there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases
firstly  what is the range of the relatives ?
for example  does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother s sister s son s daughter s nephew ?
if you say only need to tell direct relatives  it will be against the fairness of law
other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease
how can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
however  from the ethical point of view
to the carrier himself of herself  he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder
by doing this they may be able to save some lives of their relatives
it is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease  if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene s function become stronger
a typical example is genetic caused hypertension
hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension
people usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult
however  if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention
they can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension
in a nutshell  our society ca n t push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem
by doing so  less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem
in the age of rapid technological advancement  a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible
genetic testing is made possible and available for one s decision to undergo
it is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child s parentage
however  it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives
if the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives  there might have chances for them to have it in their blood  which they may do necessary precautions to prevent
but  if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease  most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it
therefore  some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret
this essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not
some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential
most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions
if one has a genetic disease after the test  he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family
some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family
furthermore  some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly
hence  some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential
on the other hand  others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk
hence  they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease
nevertheless  it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases  given in the context of current medical technology
for example  breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage
hence  with the knowledge of having genetic risk  the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up  which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage
in conclusion  it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives
although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention  such as financial issue  everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family s inherented medical conditions
however  some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life
in addition  some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease  it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it
all-in-all  it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease  but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it
genectic testing is a personal decision  with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not
those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing  even though if there is no risk at all
early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected
for a genetic risk carrier  there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives
there should not be forced or obligied to do so  as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier
with regard to this choice given  there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making
if the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child  then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian
such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age
furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family
thus  much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself
some family may feel hurt  with regards to their family pride or reputation  on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family
however  there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder
there might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree
the importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder
also  this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome
thus  having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts
and if the results turn out to be otherwise  then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions
in addition  the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them
having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family
therefore  the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family  with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others
a person with a disorder  regardless of mental or physical disorder  is always easy to be awared by his or her families
when things come to genetic issues  it is not that simple anymore
genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation  but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms
sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms
as a result  in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal  he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not
afterward  the carrier will face a serious ethical issue  which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not
if the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid  the parent will be informed by the medics for sure  then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies  condition
on contrary  if the carrier is an adult  who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk  that will be more complex
one may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself  there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue
that is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family
think of the other way  if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier  and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future  his whole life will be in a dilenma
and of course  he or she will think of not having any child after getting married  and the same thought goes to the cousins as well
as a result  the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue
in china  the older generation with traditional culture background  will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren  to make the family liven up and stronger
the reason behind is that after wowii the population of china decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth
during that period  if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms  he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure
the medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him
he has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk
and so  he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever
this kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family
in conclude  people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue
it is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives  but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family
regardlessly  if the disorder is rarely to be fatal  or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier  revealing the truth is always the right thing to do
one of the reasons why is because as a carrier  she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation
it will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own
by telling to his or her family other than being a support  they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now
other than that  i believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier
furthermore  as it is a genetic problem  it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing
by making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem  they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves
i find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious  the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society
for every action there is always pros and cons
i believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them
furthermore  as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment  the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family
i could understand the feeling of the carrier
she or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily
however  we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition
in conclusion  personally i feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue
the carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and i find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life
if anything wrong happened to the carrier s life  without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it
on top of that  it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own
in the end  i believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease
true enough that there are lots of cancer s patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one
in my opinion  as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong  we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak
as the techonology has been advancing  it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology
genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing
if used for a good purpose  it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness  however  it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is  in the family
the question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and i think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because i belive that he or she has right not to know
of course  some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier  however  the carrier  before the testing  can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts
if he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it  he could do that  and it has been something that is normal  to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible
it could rather be better for him or her this way
some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life
i personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing  so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer
however  i belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma
if the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth
i belive that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact
after realizing the he or she is tshe carrier  the emotional damage would be hard to bear
it could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family
overall  i belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still
in fact  i strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results
the emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life
on the other hand  without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact  the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the diability
i think the family will stay mentally healty as it is  without having emtional stress
debates have been around for years  that should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives
any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing  but whether the results should be informed to others  especially close family or relatives  is the topic that worth discussing
this is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved
in this essay  few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives
when we were born  we were surrounded by our family and relatives  with them welcoming us to this new world
we were crying hard but we are not alone  it s our family and relatives that grow us up
hence  they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together
however  in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder  it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news
one definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone  but it s also one s responsibility to inform the family and close relatives
as the case of health issue is related to genetic risk  with keyword on  genetic  which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation
therefore  i would agree to that it s obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future
despite one may argue that it s still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him/herself  it s certainly helpful to share with close relatives  for a proper discussion for solutions
by doing so  one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk
relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk
by informing them  the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk
on top of that  as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation  thus it will involve more than just one family
it is therefore i would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth
this would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma
there are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted
in conclusion  in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma  it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives
the benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages
more supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives
the decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder
this is the common law in the society
however  it leads to a new problem that  should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
however  there is still a diversity of point of views among the people
thus  we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is  should or should not
firstly  i believe most of us will agree with the sentences below :  i will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he or she was a carrier of a known genetic risk
frequently  the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families
it is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many
however  many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges oneself
with the families  support  there must be more energy to fight against with the demon
demon is not easily to be defeated and it is required much of energy and psychological support
families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself
that is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges
besides that  the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described
the seriousness can be larger than our imagination
lying on the bed for the remaining life  and even die immediately  these are the consequences which we can not imagine
families are our dearest in our life
without their concern and support  we are hard to stay until this time
they play the important role in our life which can not be substituted
a known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically
therefore  it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences
generally  the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier s families without the agreement of carrier
it is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients
we can not blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences
however  hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken
therefore  this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again
it is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation
however  there may be some special case that is hard to be defined
thus  advice from hospital plays the important role for this
carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society
it is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way  it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future
with the risk of being genetically disorder  many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing
with the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done  each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier
or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed
in the view of my point  a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives  with the support of the following reasons
first of all  from the angle of human right  a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others
this diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers
they may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it
this is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life
seconly  the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier
when people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers  they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it
if they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble  they may just ignore the possibility
however  if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives  the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers
this obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable
many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people  who are the relatives of the carriers  save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis
however  this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence  social influence  are taken into consideration
if one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick  he or she may have be scared about the unknown life  partners  spouse and colleagues may choose to leave  and many other situations may happen which means the relative s life may be ruined
on the other side  as stated above  a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually
in a nutshell  a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not
this should be accepted from the point of human right  freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons
otherwise  making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives
for a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier  it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder
there are four reasons why people do n t have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorder
firstly  the carrier and his or her family can take precautions  physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited to offspring and  mentally if the action fails to prevent it being inherited
many syndromes such as down syndrome and taylor syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and do n t consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period
this information may not be known by the mother if she does n t tell her relatives regarding her condition
more people  relatives  know her problem  more information channel is provided
if all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children s growth
this is not the parent s fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited
so  they have to also prepare mentally
secondly  genetic diseases costs highly for the treatment and medication
albinism is one of the examples
the people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment
unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment  people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases
if they do n t treat their body well  such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor  the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer
once you suffer from cancer  the medication cost is very expensive
to prevent the bigger problem to happen  it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body
if the carrier does n t tell his or her relatives  it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially
one of the diseases is sickle cell trait
usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking
if the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n t need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children s health
fourthly  it is important for the parents to give mental boost for their children with genetic disorder
people and friends often mock of your conditions
a strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones
if not their family then who else that are willing to do that ?
it is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder
in this modern world  the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century
particularly  in the medical field  there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases  and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder
the medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing
this is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this
as many people realize  a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier s relatives  that is  one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it  so this problem should be treated seriously by the family
every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them
if they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder  how can this explain their right ?
for instance  john is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling  james about this
although telling james about this is horrible to some extent  he should know what will be likely to be going on for him
this might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder
the next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder  preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves
genetic disorders are innate  but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves
in addition  doctors usually quote a statement   prevention is better than curation  ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it
awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person  and therefore  this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible
people who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle  including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day
this is their human right to know about that  and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen
together with the advancement of technology over past decades medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading empower doctors with advance medical knowledge doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life however  once a test has been conducted and the results are known a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor in my opinion i feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives
as it is a genetic risk the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur for example if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child hence by letting your family members aware of the situation it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children however  social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives it challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles currently  under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996  hipaa  in the united states there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives it is up to the patient s wish to disclose to their family members early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention as in the case of angelina jolie she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent i still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer
however there are still people against the decision of revealing private information as in the case of alzheimer patients it is up to the patient s own choice to disclose information however research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who how and whom will alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members  dementiatoday 2012  there are associations provide helps to alzheimer patients like alzheimer s association  alzheimer s association 1980  although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time
in conclusion the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient s decision in addition the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members although it may face challenges from social ethic issues in a long term with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones
nowadays  the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement
not long ago  the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations  mncs  has been started
in comparison  in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder  as the technology has been very mature already  an even more popular topic arises
while most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not  they have different stands in whether it is the patient s responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives
in my opinion  the patients  which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members
admittedly  it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people
to the whole society  it is a duty
take h1n1 as an example  all the people in singapore including students at school  travelers at the changi airport  workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge
to those family members who care about them  it is also a moral obligation
how can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
the basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts
hence  it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis
moreover  telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support
without the support of loved ones  patients  life is no better than death
family members  as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort  is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder
a study of new york university in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses
even for those patients with terminal diseases  the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support
some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony
while every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations  the more troubles that a family has gone through together  the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust  love and understanding
hence  for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger
just as the lyrics of kelly clarkson  what does n t kill you make you stronger
being in asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice  i do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease
the courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case
furthermore  since it is the person s gene that is affected  he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with
nevertheless  while i fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk  i would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner  husband or wife  since the individual s genetic risk may affect their future children
many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or weird
this is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as bubble-boy disease  autism or down-syndrome
while we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations  many people still do it with or without them realizing it
in this particular case  we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a risk of a particular genetic disease
it is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word risk  and assume that the person has suffered from the disease
to prevent that from happening  i do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently
especially when it is just a risk  the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer
there may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected  while i do think that this view has a point  how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case
may be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
furthermore  since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case  it is up to the person s call to tell the relatives about it
however  as i said earlier  it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later
there may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born
this piece of information does play a role in family planning matters  therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone  it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner
in conclusion  whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk  the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it
he may have different considerations other than due to the judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives  and no matter what choice he makes  we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it
with the improvements of technology  a new life with genetic risk can be detected
genetic refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease
therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
this essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk
one of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk
the child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work  to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority
they may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy
this competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive
parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself
the situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease  which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees
not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer
it is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life
there are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure
for the countries like singapore  they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation
however  every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them
without increasing number of disables in a nation  the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education
as citizens of a nation  they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways
moreover  in the world we are living today  many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day
therefore i believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child
many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world  especially people with religions
however  the problem is  will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
parents know what the best is for their children  thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed
also  human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen
one should have the full control of his/her information and it is his/her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else
as far as i am concerned  when a couple are going to have babies  they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases
the results are disclosed to husbands and wifes
the most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases
also  telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing
if person has a disease c that might be a result of gene a
he runs a test and know that he has the gene aa
this means both of his parents has gene a and they are both under high risk of having disease c they could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease c if he runs a test and know that he has the gene aa
this means one of his parents has gene a and one cost of testing could be saved
his relatives can then take measures  if this disease can some how be prevented  to stop this disease from taking their lives
however  this can also be achieved from personal choice
one can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk
most people care about their relatives  if there is no serious consequence of telling them so  i assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful
one might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results
there are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative
if a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives  he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene
he or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children
for example  if an unmarried person has gene aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease
after he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives  everyone know that he is a carrier
so all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers they might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well
if a gene runs in the family  one of the family member test positive  whom does he need to tell
if that is a big family  is he obliged to tell everyone ?
spouses usually have very close relationships  if person a tell his family that he has this gene  his uncle c knows and tells his wife d that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease
however wife d is not even under the risk of having this disease
in less than a week half of the town knows person a has a risked gene  and his family might be a genetically risked family
this is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information  especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group  relatives
carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
nowadays  people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations
since the technology of modern society has been so advanced  it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation
the debatable question  an ethical dilemma  is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
in my opinion  the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious
the first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations
the awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and health of your relatives
because if you are carrying that genetic risk  then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well
if you have n t undergone the genetic testing  it s just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives
however  if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier  you are responsible for your whole family
even though you can not eliminate the risk completely  you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease
as for those in your family who are more likely to be affected  they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly
therefore  telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility
furthermore  you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk
if your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby  it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well
being the parent  you are not responsible to you next generations  since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it
however  if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives  you offer a chance about whether to have child or not
and if you still decide to have the baby  since the technology has been developed so advanced  it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used  you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future
and in my opinion  this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place
as a conclusion  once you have undergone the genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk  there are responsibilities to your relatives  yourself  and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth
to tell or not to tell
consider a case  we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it
we found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier
then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well
every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life
many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status
once we found we were carrying this genetic risk  it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well
if we tell them  they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood
and it is important for those young people
the earlier we tell them  a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives
what s more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them
however  some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable
imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future  what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
we become so anxious that we can not focus on everything
at the same time  there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing  so actually we are bringing trouble to them
personally i feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation
since this will really affect their lives  what we should do is to try to make it in a positive way
it is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health
they will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well
i know it will have a huge impact on them  but we should know that they are our loved ones  we need to tell them and help them
a genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell
genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease
once the test is done  whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy
some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected
this essay will illustrate in two aspects
first of all  it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have
as we all know  genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members
once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic  other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease
therefore  telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment
sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment
so for the consideration for the other family members  the relatives should be informed
secondly  it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies
they should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage
they need to ask for doctor s advice before they plan to have a baby
some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls  some are on the contrary
if the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse  another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease
i noticed a real story on newspaper years ago
a couple in china have a son of 5 years old
their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious
they were told that the wife s family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls
therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease
however  the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband
the son was died after one year s treatment and the couple got divorced later after that
if the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor s advice before they have baby  the tragic would not happen
in a nutshell  a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives
on the one hand  it can tell members of the carrier s family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible
on the other hand  it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth
nowadays  with the advancement of technology  it is easy to do a genetic testing
we can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem
however  i thought that the genetic information is one person s personal privacy which should be protected by the law
therefore  i thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives
there are three reasons as follows
firstly  the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people s bank card key
other people should not be told without the person s permission even though they are his or her family or relatives
the government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy
once people s genetic information is told to other people
they may know the person s potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally
they may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her
people do not have the ability to choose their gene  they should not be thought badly because of bad gene
so i think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents  it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives
secondly  the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult
once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them
however happy they were before  there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually
the relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter
the parents give knowledge and love to the children  meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children
the children rely the parent to live
when they grow up  they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication
the relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication
everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk
therefore  i think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person s permission
finally  the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now
there also exists some probability of wrong testing
if the wrong testing was not found by the doctor  the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life
therefore i think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives
therefore  considering the people s privacy and the existence of wrong testing  for the peace of the family  i support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person s permission
more and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology
people will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test
however  not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes
therefore  once people find they have carried the disease genes  they should be responsible to tell their relatives  at least their family members
it may be awkward and embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk
but they are all from one family and own the same forefather  then of course they own the same genes in some part
therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of
if the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene  his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also get a disease gene
then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur
also they can prevent the disease going to their offspring
if the relatives carry that disease gene  they can share the experience with him or her and give some help  they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue
if he or her not get married  he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries disease gene
or else  if he holds back the genetic risk  they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage
a couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time  their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem
after came back from the hospital  the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time
the woman did not know the test result  but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband
after got the divorce certificate  the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man
at that time  the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness
tears showed nothing
people can not avoid carrying the disease genes  which they born with
however  they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children
by telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely  also many risks and conflicts can be avoided
genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder
however  there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier s family once the test has been conducted and the results are known
i am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result
though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results  while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist  the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know
then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations
taking angeline jolie for example  she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk
everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope
in some cases  a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others  risk somehow
however  i believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation
in addition  though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life  how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation
life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair
it is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time
furthermore  living with a secret is not a good sensation  especially if the situations of other relatives become worse  you should feel guilty and depressed
moreover  the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed  more shocking and upset it will be
as the result  it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives  telling the genetic testing result is needed
last but not least  though genetic testing is a personal matter  telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone s health
that plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks
to put it in the nutshell  i believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health
it can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family
in addition  emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he/she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing
social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today
it is almost imposible for us to keep way from it
i started invoving into facebook one years ago when i just arrived singapore
and now i got over 500 friends on facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day
we know each others  status  changements and so on through the social media
for an example  if we change our contact numbers  we will not send sms to each of individual any longer
instead  we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments
in certain aspects  social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience
it is becoming even more convinient than talking throught the phone since it is free
we discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like
and also  we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better
socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on
and actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on
with more convinient and humanian communications  the relationship between government and people get largely improved
what s more  various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias
we can know more news and cultures through socia medias
from this scope  social media has shorten our distance
however  we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient  advanced and interesting
and even we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again
when we are far away  social media makes it as we are infront of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others  side  we are seem to be further than far away
this kind of feeling makes people s relationship not as stable  secure and reliable than before
besides  there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience
to some extent  this makes our life more luxry and blundering
for myself  i am long to some places after i saw those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds
sometimes i even canoot sleep well because of excitement
social media makes our life patten so fast and left us less time to think about our life
social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better
interpersonal skills  like any other skills requires practice
besides that  these skills requires time to develop and adapted
the burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things  it is better to have them in moderation
convenience and efficiency are two very important use of social media
while millions of users are connect at any one time  any information can be readily available at their perusal
for an example  one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously  over the web and the process takes seconds
the receipent will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network
this covenience can be percieved as almost in realtime
next  communication are also greatly improved
in the past  vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram  snail mail and poor-quality voice calls
with the welcoming of application such as skype and facetime  any individual can phase off most  of the olden days communication methods
aside from hearing the voice  a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a real  interaction with expressions and gestures
communication would have took a different turn without the easily available social media
however  it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time
intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions  particularly the touch
having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recepient
it involves a level of dynamic interaction which utlises the motor  thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate
unlike the use of social media  most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing
as a result  one does not train the necessarily parts of the skills required for a proper interpersonal relations
it is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill
howard garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it  some does not
howard garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted  in accordance of utilising tests  and ranked
fundamentally  those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed
though social media need not be necessarily bad  it must be used accordingly - for work  family  friends
the space of separation between the parties must also be looked at
for people who are living very far from one another  the intensive use social media is justified
for those who lives within the community should at least meet up  and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other
and at the same time  improves the interpersonal skill  through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence
the inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting
recently  the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other  it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings
in my opinion  social media websides such as twitter and facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills
on the other hand  it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people
first  social media networks have a lot user base  it helps to link people from different parts of the world
in the days without the social networks  people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before
their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners
therefore  social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before  and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well
secondly  although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face  they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life
for example  if social network does not exist  the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming  even sometimes with business that is not so important  it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage
however  social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier  they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time
nowadays  even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost
the social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people
the largest negative impact is that due to the online network  some people start to use and rely on internet every minute
they take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life
it not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people s health if the ones spend to much time on the social media
secondly  social network may leak certain personal informations to the public  as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe  people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes  some people may use others personal information to deceive
in conclusion  although the unsafe online environment  spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks
it provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others
it also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating
overall  there are more benefits than the costs
the wolrd is incresingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network website such as facebook and twitter
we can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media
from some points of view  social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently
however  its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime
social network sites provides us many convenience
without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone  we can know his of her latest news by scaning the webpage
it can help us know more about each other
it can make people become closer as well
for example  if you find out one of your friend s favourite singer is justin biber through facebook  you can give him or her justin biber s new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift
it will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer
in addition  social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away
i met some canadian friends in egypt
without facebook  we may lost contact
however  thanks to facebook  i can still keep in touch with them and i know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other
the disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable
a research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public
it means that one can not know another s real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media
it will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life
in addition  with all those  nice  guys around on the social network website  one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook
it is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone
this kind of behaviour is not good to people s psychological health according to a research
the cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication
in addition  cyber relationship can not always work in real life
with no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends  one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses
with the willing of people to become the best among others  social network site now become a place to show off
some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so
it is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material
the last but not the least  with all kinds of personal information on one s social network page  it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime
above all  social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as put less personal information on his or her facebook page
this phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology  which has made communication to be faster than never before
today  social media sites  such as facebook and twitter  are relatively common within the contemporary society ; and  people can communicate with each other  online or offline  on these social networking platforms
they can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms  which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world
however  critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends
this essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society
there are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media
this is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers
furthermore  with the current technology  smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use
hence  social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them
however  critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable
for example  in 2012  there were false rumors of fires  shootouts  and caravans of gunmen in a mexico city suburb which had spread through twitter and facebook
this had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls  and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools
the spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone  given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed
nevertheless  there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around
but  there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement
social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends  provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties
many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media  regardless of their location
in the past  people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over
therefore  with the help of technology  people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently
furthermore  it will be easier to make new friends find who have simliar interests or hobbies
however  in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends  it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties
it might not be accurate to judge the other party s feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media
in addition  there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms
but  if there is trust and mutual understand on social media  it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends
in conclusion  social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends  as well as  disseminate information efficiently to the masses
nevertheless  the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of
all-in-all  social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future
advantages : social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience
with a globalised and interconnected world today  twitter and facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction
with just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices  one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle
thus  long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier
with the sharing of personal photos  posting of status of one s personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease
introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform
thus  socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another  making human interaction possible at one s own convenience
the society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction
with the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the internet  a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world
disadvantages : one of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility
the certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction  except when using a webcam to chat
we can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the inetrnet
we may in actual fact communicating with a hoax facebook acccount of a cyber friend  which we assume to be real but in reality  it is a fake account
photos and informations retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda
although emocons can be used to show certain emotion  this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression
the danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction
furthermore  this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups
this lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one s behaviour
the lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others
therefore  for an effective and efficient society  there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people
nowadays  people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world
people use twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and facebook to see what is their friends  recent activity
nevertheless  they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact
not only the phone did the jobs for them  but also devices like personal computer  laptop  tablet  and many other devices which are able to connect to internet
it is obvious to see that internet saves people s time and also connect people globally
several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people
people can only use electical devices to access internet
whenever they need to use social media  they have to use a phone or internet
generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device
as a result  they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them  which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating
a family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting  because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork
a group of friends having high tea in a caf  without chatting as well  because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen
the children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them  all they know is pressing icons on the screens
these are some concrete examples of how the socia media reduce face-to-face human contact
when people get use of using socia media to contact other people  what will happen is that their interpersonal communicating skills will degrade and lost eventually
firstly  they have lost the courage to meet strangers  not even the courage to talk
also  they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills
as a result  social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills
social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being
first of all  people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news
a father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family
he can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet
secondly  people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily
a guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity
when one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls  he might be able to get his whereabout using social media
these are the advantages that save works most of the time
in conclude  socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people
people should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way
with the aids of social media  people bonds globally  information flows rapidly  and human lives happily
all of us are living in the technology realm society
have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
it started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades
in the past  we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so
in the past  it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now  we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages
from the example that i have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart
this is because by the ease of technology such as airplane  some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life
thus  this makes twitter and facebook become one of the medium that we need
the next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society
social media sites such as facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas
this approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas
the social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance
it might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family
as i mentioned in the beginning  there is also disadvantages of social media tools
one of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters
this is because it is part of everyone s habit to check their facebook s page as their friends will post something new every second
thus  you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures
this means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so
this will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted
in my opinion  every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision
there are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites  however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do
nowadays  the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives
in increasingly globalised world  such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world
thanks to them  people can get to know one another online  without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons
however  it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world  resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul s daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole
as people spend more and more time on such social media sites  the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed
as people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot  they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online
this results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual  especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online
this becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life
as they are so used to having an online avatar  they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact people in real-life
another problem with social media is that  the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users
the reason why it is so addictive is  that the more people get into the social media  they seek attention from their friends
however  such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user s life
also  according to a research  it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people s lives
but seriously  most people only post the happiest moments in their lives
social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay is the links among the people
indeed  i myself use facebook just because of the friends  contacts that i want to keep
however  the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life
also  as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites  they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements
furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users
as this happens  users are more and more pron to any possible frauds
social media sites are at their peaks at the moment  however  i believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life  they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now
the users  soon  will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because  if they really need somebody  they will reach the friends no matter what
we think we are all connected through all sorts of social media  but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
social media sites like facebook and twitter are born with the intention of connecting people  from around the world
the idea seems great  and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like facebook
the parents are now the  friends  of their kids  and they can now  follow  their kids more closely and on real time
people post about their random thoughts or daily activities via twitter and post different kinds of photos on facebook frequently  to be connected with their so called friends
however  as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact  that eventually affects our interpersonal skills
first and foremost  i would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life
as a student  i tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings
we may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch
unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call  social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected
within clicks  we could check on the friend s profile and read on for his/her updates
on another hand  we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed
this allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way
not only that  new friends can be easily met through such online platforms
nonetheless  what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart
the obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time reduction on face-to-face contact
this subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle
for example  we tend send a birthday wishes when facebook promts us  today is someone s birthday
we used to send wishes cards during festive season like chinese new year  and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it
gone were the times  and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes
as time passed  we may have more  friends  on the list  but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined
in a nutshell  every sword has two edges
the users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one
we should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have
ultimately  the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it
nowadays  social media sites are commonly used in the society
i believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites
it consists of the function of connecting  sharing  interacting and advertising
however  there are also some disadvantages occur due to the social media which are concerned in the society
therefore  this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life
first  with the function of social media sites that connects the people  everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families  or even strangers without any time and place constraints
through the social media sites  we can chat with our friends who stay in europe and new zealand
there are over thousand miles between singapore and these two countries
however  we are able to chat with our friends without travel to the countries
it saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world
besides that  company also can use the convenience of social media sites  such as facebook chat or skype to facilitate the meeting with parties of project from around the world
substantial cost is saved without the tiring travel from one point to another point
with the huge amount of cost savings  this capital can be utilized in the other sectors which benefits company more and boost up the company s profit
however  there are two sides of stories always
some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human
since ancient times  human interact with others face by face
without the facial impression  it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers
that is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning
in addition   social media sites will affect writing skills   that is the point of view in society
based on the statistic report  the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites
i believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forget how to write a word that we should know
the auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing
writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions
privacy   this is the word that popular in these few decades
human has their own rights and privacy
however  there is news about the social media sites leaks users  information to companies with cash reimbursement
everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising
although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want  you are actually wrong
you are not only controlled by the government laws but also spied by the government
in conclusion  everything has two sides of stories
to utilize the technology well  we should do our effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons
thus  the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation
with the wide spread of advanced technology  social media sites are becoming more and more popular
getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays
on one side  it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives
social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere
whether we are at home or at school  at work or on a holiday  we are able to communicate and interact with our friends
even when people are thousands of miles apart  social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments
when our phones are accidentally done  we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends
some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media
besides  we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in
therefore  the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends  status and contact with friends more frequently
on the other side  we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media
there are still many disadvantages of using social media
while social media brings convenience to people life  people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement
people who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people  and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation
secondly  people s over-addition may avoidably  to some degree  exacerbate social alienation  and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking
more and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life
this is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt
thirdly  a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people s daily life more and more grandiloquent  which is not an accurate social growing trend
again  there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced
since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media  and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us  this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time
therefore  everytime when we use social media  we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages
only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media
in the sophisticated era like these days  experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier
geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously
telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time graham bell introduced it
however  since internet were known  telephone started to give way to social media sites
many advantages are given to the users
let us take example from facebook and twitter  two of the most famous social media sites
through facebook  peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances
this benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people s particular and address may change from time to time while on facebook  people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo  for example  as the identifier
facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service  personal profile  media of sharing  and other entertainment add-on  i e
social games  which allow users to communicate with remote people  and also to update and express themselves at the same time
twitter  that has more simplified function compared to facebook  gives more benefit if used as information sharing media
twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast  that only highlighted messages are delivered
for facebook  a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded  long notes can be published  even documents and data can be shared through facebook nowadays
these advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones
despite the luxury that is offered by social media  there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand
researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing
as the consequence  it affects their interpersonal skills
people can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication  every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality
this skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media
there is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget  posting picture in facebook  updating status on twitter  or even chatting with friends
these social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n t mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff
this is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before  that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget  not facing human being
another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives  we build  false image  in public
we tend to only share our happy moments in media
because of this  other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all
as a result  people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder
this is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people
as explained above  modern and sophisticated technology does n t always give advantages
there are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of
it is up to people s discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take
so  we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make
nowadays  the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot
in most of the countries  there is an emergence of social media sites such as facebook and twitter
many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society
one of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before
in the past decades  when the social media sites are not yet fully developed  people connect with others who live far away by using a phone  or even a letter
however  calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost  and sending a letter to a person who live far away  especially in villages  takes much time
the appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved
people connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication  and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach
moreover  this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time  such as their friends in primary school and secondary school
as we graduate from a school  we will probably lose contact with some of our friends
some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses  and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter
if phone and letter are the only way to contact them  we would probably not able to find them
facebook and twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends
hence  the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection
everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages
on the other hand  social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society
the advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face
many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites
the usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life  which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people
as we all know  the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas
the lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas
as a result  they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society
as a part of this modern society  we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies  and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites
with the advancement of technology in recent years  the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand
with an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world  social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life
however  there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact  which in turn affects interpersonal skills
all users  needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a facebook or twitter id to start their journey in social media life
secondly  it helps people to keep in-touch with one another
finding old friends through facebook  for example  is more easier than asking people around in real life
thirdly  social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world  all with a click away on the refresh button
last but not least  social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups  pages or sites to share our hobbies  interests and studies in particular subjects
hence  it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world
however  social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human
undeniable  it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually
we spend majority of our time on sites like facebook  twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance
in corporate world  employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work
using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term
the more time we spend on these sites  the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interacting with one another
hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone
in addition  there are also some false reports and fake ids occur on both social media sites that people use fake id to insult or harass someone  like the case of heather chua occurred recently on facebook
these malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life  which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim
in conclusion  everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it
with current booming technology  it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites  however  it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life
as more and more social websites such as twitter  facebook and weibo which have become ubiquitous  seamless and imperative in our life  people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills
however  i believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions
social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday
with a small smart phone or a computer at school  at work or at home  we can easily make friends worldwide with a click  and get to know about their life through having conversations with them  reading their blogs  photos and status
compared to face-to-face interaction  online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other
moreover  people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off
this has been indicated in a report done by boston university in 2012  80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life
this shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account
that is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world
although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful  such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments  we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online
people around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments
that eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them
one of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in egypt and zambia
the idea of searching for democracy is passed from egyptians to people in zambia quickly through the use of social media
however  as the government controls most of the media
these social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public
for example  in 2012 general election is singapore  dr tan chee keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public
though because of this  social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias
intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication
it is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands
what we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well
in conclusion  the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes
social media sites  role in connecting people around the world is undeniable
thank to those social media  the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease
apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance  many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well
nevertheless  with those advantages  some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills  privacy issue  as well as some frauds that can be done through social media
through those sites we are able to talk to them  to know what their activities are and who their friends are  etc from the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance
the sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well  that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account  for example channel news asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news
that shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media
furthermore  since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media  these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports
due to the popularity of social media  many people start to do their business via these sites
more and more advertisements can be found on facebook  whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online  we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites  which can be considered as an advantage for us  the buyers
however  is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
i do think there is difference in it and i believe many of us will agree
when we write or communicate virtually  we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us
other than that  sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language  and thus the tone  of the message sent and when it is received may be different
many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all
this will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts
nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even real
some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others
in addition  privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place
therefore  while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life  we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible
it is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today
not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture
some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution
social media sites like twitter and facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries
it also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place
this essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life
one of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily  even without contact for a long time
in this fast pace and competitive world  people may not able to keep in touch with others
with the help of social media site  people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated the new information of their friends
personally i am study in oversea  busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend
using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays
and i am able to easily find a common topic when i contact them
in singapore  many malaysian cross the sea to work here
many of them are busy in work and separate with their children
one of manager in my working place has the same situation
after my manager taught her mother how to use facebook  she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild
therefore my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter s growth
social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship
people get connected or closer with same preferences
it is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information
students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries
people are able to share the culture or pretty photos online  therefore others can spread the joy with them
thus i believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better
however  social media site is a double-sided sword  it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life
one of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication
many people like to use language to pretend themselves  and lost confidence when they talk to each other
although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites  we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills
in conclusion  the shadow always exists when there is light
we should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects
social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world
the use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another
online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online
social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly
there are advantages and disadvantages in this change
social media has reshaped the way of communication
we share ideas  stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect
when we use facebook and post pictures and statuses
we are actively  presenting  fa  ades of our lifes in front of others
we tend to post pictures with the best looks  status that are funny
we broadcast these facades of us to others
the images we choose to present are tentatively considered
there is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one s true opinion on social networks
on the other hand  the viewers  are not the listeners
they are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny
this type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships
in real life  establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another
the latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other
one can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present
one can not truly show their emotions by another by texting some =  signs
with my social network account  i seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because i can easily read them from the status of my friends
if i am interested in politics  i can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures
i get news for sales  clothes and cosmetics from my friends
if some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he/she posts them often  i can simply block him/her off
information got circulated
the most popular information get circulated the most so i can seldom miss it
social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information
this saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching tv
personally i feel more at ease on social medias
from the above two points of view i think social media could forge more interest-based friendships
with the help of social media  i become real life friends with those from online forums whom i share the same interest with
i also discover some of my friends  interest which i find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life  study  friends  etc
the communication does not focus on how we feel  or to say  each otherm  but whatever is interesting  or the content
in this case  interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody  but to get the information that we are both interested in
in conclusion  i think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends  to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest
there are advantages and disadvantages in itself  however  whether it is good or bad we are still not sure
people that living in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like twitter and facebook
almost all students and young adults possess the facebook or twitter account
it is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently
however  it seems that  especially for some those  sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary
an extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table  but none of them were really chatting with one another
therefore  there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media
social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another
people used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past
it can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages
nowadays  what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms
and people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message
distance and time are no longer the problems  which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed
social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication
when ones chat on those media sites  there is no eye connection  no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations
people indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can
while  once they are communicating with people in their face  expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem
social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests
for example  on twitter  it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars  business men and entrepreneurs
it makes people feel extreme close to their admirers  lives and works
updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time
however  after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable  all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future
the profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is
but there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you
no pledge of authenticity risks people s information and privacy that are shared on social media sites
to sum up  social media has advantages and disadvantages in people s daily life
it shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible
on the contrary  social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites
as the development of the technology  social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world
everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better
however  it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster
although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are  it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills
thus  whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being
many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world
this is especially to people who are overseas
to them  social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well
what s more  these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information
nowadays  people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience
it is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day
however  there are also a great amount of people who against this technology
they worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves
they pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face
the more we care about facebook  the less time we will have to spend with our friends
nowadays  it is quite common to see on some party  people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored
it makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently  they will decrease the ability to talk to people
they will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people
personally  i strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us
although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life  it wastes us a lot of time as well
think in another way  if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites  we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things
we should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends
everything will be bad if we do n t know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not
as stated above  i strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it  we will all live a better life
the advantage and disadvantage of social media
nowadays  as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced  more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life
you can see people playing facebook  twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains
some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face
firstly of all  social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other
years ago when these modern products have not been popular  the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls  sending emails or writing letters
some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response
however  social media solves these problems well
people can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast
the communication is also not limited in words
people can express themselves through pictures or emotions
people can also get to know their friends  state and mood by looking at their posts on line
moreover  people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites
these social media makes people s life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun
however  social media may do some harm to people s life
it will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected
some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life
actually  i have seen some people are very funny and interesting when i am chatting with them online
however  they behave quite boring when i talk to them in real life
teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up
if they spend too much time on these social media  it may cause some problems to their mental development
some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves
in conclusion  the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword
people can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media
whereas  it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills
but overall  the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage
so we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring
and try to bypass the shortcomings
remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently
people can know their friends  recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites
we can not deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country
however  the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills
there are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people s daily life
firstly  the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely
by typing the words and showing the pictures  people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express
for example  on mother s day  people are shy to say  i love you  to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother s facebook page
then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm
on the other hand  when the teenager is studying in a foreign country  the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends
therefore  the social media is truly good for people
secondly  the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely
people can also know much information about the celebrity in twitter and facebook such as obama  bill gates and get the first-hand study materials on it
they can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons  thought by using the social media
on the other hand  with the help of social media  some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information  his or her will share it to their  friends area   then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help
on the other hand  there are also problems with the population of the social media
firstly  when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents  they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking
people even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication
therefore  the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends
secondly  without the truly communication in the real life  people lose the ability to see the truth and false
there are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages  however in real life  he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly
teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe
therefore  the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager s future development
all in all  the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas
however  there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree
advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society
nowadays  with the development of technology and society  social media become more popular and even important in our daily life
we communicate with others using social media  such as twitter  facebook and microblog more and more frequently
there is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others  they chat online  share pictures  tell others what they have done or funny stories
it seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media  but the problems come out
pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face  especially the strangers
then  we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society
as for the advantages  there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others  easier to know about others
one advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media
in old days  if one wants to tell some important news to another one  which lives far away  he needs to write letters and it wastes time
the long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time
therefore  people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important
however  people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time  and there is no time delay of messages
the other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media
if there is no social media  it is difficult for people to know about a stranger
they may collect information about that person by asking his friends  colleagues or family members
and the information collected may not be intact and true
unlike today  with the help with social media  people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line  and know about what that person did everyday at what time
as for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life  wasting time  causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer  quick-spread of rumor and fake news  most importantly  making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently
it is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other
if there is a joke on their facebook page  they may talk to others in this way   hi  look  how ridiculous this is   then they laugh together
no matter it is a party  dinner or just simply get-together  there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them
in a conclusion  there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
people should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family
today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like facebook and twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world
however  some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact
the advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows
nobody can deny social media s advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities  races  cultures and languages
social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications
firstly  social media brings convenience to the world
it has erased the boundaries of distance and time
no more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages
nowadays  thanks to the help of social media  with just one click  you can contact your family and friends wherever you want
you can share photos  videos and every meaningful experiences of your life
secondly  social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting
young people can widen their relationships  meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world
in business area  social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services
on the other hand  social media also has disadvantages which have created worries to the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon
more and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact  which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life
first and foremost  we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real
everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want
though social media do create relationships  relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction
there is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years
she talked with them every night  trust them and share her life with them
then eventually  she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time
last but not least  social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people
as a result  if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend  it will cause a bad effect on the young generation
to put it in the nutshell  everything has its own pros and cons
so does social media network
it not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills
social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people s potentials to the fullest
